# Alarm Clock

This is a Python project that implements an alarm clock using the `datetime`,`customtkinter` ,`tkinter`, `PIL`,`time`,`threading`, and `pygame` libraries. The alarm clock allows the user to set an alarm time, choose a ringtone, and add a custom message to be displayed when the alarm goes off.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

You will also need to install the following libraries using pip:

```
pip install Pillow
pip install pygame
pip install customtkinter
```

## Usage

To use the alarm clock, run the `alarm_clock.py` file in a Python environment. This will open a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to set the alarm time, choose a ringtone, and add a custom message.

To set the alarm time, use the drop-down menus to select the hour and minute, and click the "Set alarm" button. The alarm time will be displayed in the format "HH:MM:SS".

To choose a ringtone, select one of the options from the "Ringtones" drop-down menu. You can preview the selected ringtone by clicking the speaker icon.

To add a custom message, enter the message text in the "Message" field.

When the current time matches the alarm time, the selected ringtone will play and the custom message will be displayed in a message box.

To quit the alarm clock, click the "Quit" button.
