Sure, here's a possible README.md file for the OTP Verification GUI project on Github:

# OTP Verification GUI

This is a Python project that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for verifying one-time passwords (OTPs) sent via email. The GUI allows users to enter their email address, receive an OTP, and enter the OTP to verify their identity. The project uses the Gmail SMTP server to send email messages.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need to install the following Python packages:

- `Pillow` (for image processing)
- `smtplib` (for sending email)
- `ssl` (for secure email communication)
- `tkinter` (for GUI development)

You can install these packages using `pip`, the Python package manager, by running the following command:

```
pip install Pillow smtplib ssl tkinter
```

## Usage

To run the OTP Verification GUI, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

```
python OTP_Verification.py
```

This will launch the GUI window. Enter your email address in the email field and click the "Send OTP" button. An OTP will be sent to your email address. Enter the OTP in the OTP field and click the "Verify" button. If the OTP is correct, a message box will appear saying "OTP verified!". Otherwise, a message box will appear saying "Invalid OTP. Please try again."

## Customization

You can customize the sender email and password, SMTP server, SMTP port, and email message by modifying the `sender_email`, `sender_password`, `smtp_server`, `smtp_port`, `subject`, and `body` variables in the `OTPVerificationGUI` class.

You can also customize the GUI layout and design by modifying the `OTPVerificationGUI` class and the `customtkinter` module.
