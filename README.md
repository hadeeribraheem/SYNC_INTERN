# SYNC INTERN'S

This repository contains the virtual internship tasks for Sync Intern's Python Internship. The internship includes the following projects:

1. **Build an Alarm Clock**: A Python program that allows users to set an alarm for a specific time and plays a sound when the alarm goes off.

2. **OTP Verification**: A Python program that generates a random OTP and sends it to the user via email or SMS. The user can then enter the OTP to verify their identity.

3. **URL Shortener**: A Python program that shortens a long URL into a shorter, more manageable URL. This can be useful for sharing links on social media or in emails.

4. **Chatbot**: A Python program that uses natural language processing (NLP) to simulate a conversation with a user. The chatbot can answer questions, provide information, and perform simple tasks.

Each project is contained in its own directory and includes a README.md file with instructions on how to run the program and any dependencies required. 

Feel free to explore the projects and modify the code to suit your needs. Happy coding!
